Hello moodle user,

If you're reading this, you're a very wise person that likes to know what you're doing,
so I congratulate you :)

In the instructions below, MOODLE_HOME is the path to where your Moodle is
deployed in your server.

The best way to install this plug-in is directly through https://moodle.org/plugins/auth_emailadmin
by clicking on 'Install Now'. If you do that, you can skip step 1 below (but not 1.1 and 1.2).

Otherwise, to install this plugin:

1- Upload/unpack everything under:
MOODLE_HOME/auth/emailadmin

NOTE 1: You have to create the 'emailadmin' folder.

NOTE 2: if the package you got the files from put them within a folder of its own,
remove the files from that folder. For example, there should *NOT* be a "moodle-auth_emailadmin"
folder under "MOODLE_HOME/auth/emailadmin".

1.1- Customize the email messages under lang/en/auth_emailadmin.php. If you
do it later, you may have to "Purge All Caches". See below.

1.2- If your Moodle is in a language other than English, you may have to make a copy of lang/en to lang/your-language.

2- Login to Moodle with your admin account.

3- Go to:
Site Administration --> Plugins --> Authentication --> Manage Authentication

4- Enable "Email-based self-registration with admin configuration".

5- On the same page, below "Common settings", for "Self registration", select
"Email-based self-registration with admin confirmation".

5.1- To ensure that the 'Create New User' button is available on the 'Sign In' page, go to 

Site Administration --> Plug-ins --> Authentication --> Manage Authentication

and set some instructions under 'Instructions (auth_instructions)'.

**It must not be empty!**

6- Save changes

7- If you customize the email messages after the plugin was loaded (I.e. what steps 1.1 and 1.2 say 
but at this time), go to:
Development --> Purge all caches

8- Purge the caches.

9- Try it out!
