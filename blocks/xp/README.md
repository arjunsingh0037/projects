Requirements
------------

Moodle 2.7 or greater.

Installation
------------

Simply install the plugin and add the block to a course page.

The plugin can be installed using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) at [fmcorz/moodle-block_xp](https://packagist.org/packages/fmcorz/moodle-block_xp).

How are experience points calculated?
-------------------------------------

This block listens to events triggered in Moodle and captures some according to pre-defined rules. It then attributes experience points based on the information contained in the event. For more information about the events, refer to the [documentation](http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2#Information_contained_in_events).

Only the users with the capability _block/xp:earnxp_ can earn experience points. This capability is given by default to students. Also actions triggered by guests, non-logged in users or administrators are ignored.

The following events are always __ignored__:

- Events from another context than course or module
- Events having another _educational level_ than _participating_
- Events flagged as _anonymous_, e.g. in an anonymous Feedback

The rest is up to you. By default the plugin comes with a minimal set of rules to attribute experience points to actions, and to ignore some redundant ones. Visit the _Rules_ page in the plugin itself to view or override them.

_Note_: Repeated actions within a short time interval are ignored to prevent cheating.

Restricting access based on students' levels
--------------------------------------------

Have a look at this availability plugin [Level](https://github.com/FMCorz/moodle-availability_xp).

How to use one block for all courses
------------------------------------

In order to gather experience points from all the courses a student is participating in, you have to set the admin setting _Where are experience points used?_ to 'For the whole site'. This setting is located under "Site administration > Plugins > Blocks > Level up!". Once set, any block newly or previously added will display the total experience points of your student.
