THEME_Fordson
===========

# Fordson

Fordson is a child theme for Moodle's core theme Boost.

It is built on Boostrap4 and Mustache templates.

Here are the main enhancements:
* Presets - Both uploaded and a set of pre-installed presets to quickly adjust colors
* Colours - A variety of color pickers to help customize and fine tune presets
* Images - Custom Login, Custom Page Header, Custom Course Header, and Custom Page Background image uploads
* Social Icons - Quickly add all your social media buttons in the footer
* Enhanced Frontpage - Navigation Iconbar, Custom Textbox, Alertbox, Six Marketing Tiles
* Customized Course Header Image - Teachers can upload an image into their course summary files and it will automatically be used in the header of their course.

## Recommended Settings for Best Results
These settings below are found in the Moodle Site Administration Pages.  These are not related to the theme but will help bring out the best of Fordson.  

* defaulthomepage = SITE (Default homepage for users.  If set to Dashboard your users will not see the Enhanced Homepage upon login.)
* frontpage = none (Frontpage items to show. Part of Moodle Frontpage Settings tab.)
* frontpageloggedin = none or Enrolled Courses (Frontpage items to show when logged in. Part of Moodle Frontpage Settings tab.)
* Optional: forcelogin = Checked (This forces users to login before seeing the homepage.)

Fordson is a child theme of Boost.  
This means when Moodle updates the core Boost theme those changes will be applied to Fordson as well in most cases.

# Install from Github
Click on the button to "Clone or Download" https://github.com/dbnschools/moodle-theme_fordson . When downloaded to your computer, unzip it. It should create a folder named "moodle-theme_fordson-master". Rename the folder so that it is "fordson" (without quotes). You can FTP that folder to your moodle site in /moodle/theme/ directory. Or you can create a new ZIP file of the "fordson" folder and upload and install it via the Plugin Administration in Site Administration. 

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.9
* New Preset - Corporate Learner.  Very simple, no background image preset.  Most colors are tied to 2 settings: Brand Primary and Body Background Colour.  Changing these two colors will drastically alter the look of the page.  Designed to be distraction free with minimal color.  This preset gives you all the features of Fordson with the simplicity of the Boost theme.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.8
* Fixed issue where site uses custom roles to define teacher and non-editing teacher roles.  This caused Fordson to not identify the teacher role to display contact information to the student in the student "This Course" panel. This caused Fordson to display all users of the course as teachers.  This fix will show no users as teachers.  In file classes/output/core_renderer.php you can find code comments on where you should change the teacher and non-editing teacher shortnames to match your customized roles around lines 775 and 797.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.7
* New Activity Completion Report Link was added to the teacher dashboard panel just below Participants link. 
* Unique CSS classes for student buttons in This Course dashboard.  Can be used to hide the Course Administration button for students if not needed.
* Fixed issue with $gradeslink variable for dashboard template.  Used same name twice.  Changed variable for grade view student to $gradeslinkstudent.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.6
* New Course Style 4 is exactly the same as style one but adds a course summary back into the display.  This was at the request of a user.  It is the only course display option that includes a course summary.
* New Add Activity/Resource picker feature- Control the "Add an Activity or Resource" panel in courses.  Using a comma separated list you can add a list of top or commonly used activities or choose to only show custom items.  This gives you control over what items a teacher can use and how they are presented (ordering) to the teacher.  Special thanks to Oliver Jackson at https://www.hillbrook.qld.edu.au/.  I saw he had forked Fordson on Github and had added some customizations.  This being one of them.  This is a great feature!
* New Custom Label for Activity/Resource custom menu of modules.  This allows you to call the module label whatever you want. "Top Modules", "Most Used Activities", "Learning Tools", etc are examples.
* New permissions for Activity/Resource menu.  If restricted, teachers will only see the custom menu.  However, with the new checkbox you can allow users with the role of Manager to see all acitivities and resources.  Site Administrators will always see all menu items regardless of settings.
* Added Participants link for teachers in the course management panel.  This is still available in the nav drawer for students.  Since Moodle has announced the possible merging of participants and users I am holding off on any further integrations until we see what happens.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.5
* New Feature:  Pick from 3 different styles to display courses on the frontpage as well as course category and search pages.  Each style has unique look and feel.  
* Cleaned up some of the content area settings page to group settings.
* Course Tile Height setting now applies to all three styles as well as anywhere the course tile may appear.
* New setting to control the spacing on the sides of the main content box.  
* CSS and styling fixes.
* Added teacher names to course tile display.  Removed course summary.  May revisit in future if I can find a cleaner way to all the information in a small tiled box. Our students need to see the teacher name to identify the proper course.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.4
* Added option to toggle on/off course category icons.  The icons were removed in previous version but we realize some may find them useful and better than the Moodle default.  

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.3 2017062200
* Major change to course directory listings.  We opted to remove the icon display of categories.  User feedback suggested this was too many clicks and a useability issue when browsing for a course.  Instead of icons, we kept courses displayed as boxes and used the default Moodle list category display which allows the user to collapse and expand to view courses as boxes.  This makes browsing courses MUCH faster and easier for the user.
* Removed category icon setting.
* Added Manage Course Completion to the Teacher Dashboard as a menu item.
* Fixed issue when courseoverviewfileslimit is 0.  https://github.com/dbnschools/moodle-theme_fordson/issues/4

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.2 2017062000 Design and Style
* New Preset - Default Fullscreen Background.  This is exactly the same as the default preset but the image background for each course is fullscreen instead of just a block at the top of the page.
* New activity icon colors and size fixes thanks to Michelle Lomman.
* New icon for student dashboard (This Course) which will allow the student to unenroll.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.5.0 2017051900

* New Icons for Acitivities, Resources, and File Types.  Can be removed if you delete the pix_plugins & Pix_core folders. Icon credits: https://material.io , https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/freebie-of-the-week/beautiful-flat-icons-for-free , https://www.iconfinder.com/
* CSS adjustments to maximize screen space on small devices.  Removed padding and margins for certain elements.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.4.9 2017051900
* Fixed header image so that only one image is served to the page. This will help with page load times. It also eliminates using prescss to attach the background image to a css class.
* Added show/hide toggle for frontpage custom login form. Default is show.
* Added scroll to top button and admin setting to turn it on and off.


## Fordson Moodle 33 1.4.8 2017051800

* New branding in footer area with Organization name, website, email, phone
* Better layout in footer to better present footer content
* Smaller social icons in footer
* General CSS fixes
* Stripped html from course summary when displaying in student dashboard "This Course" drop down.  This will fix bad html and some other issues that caused display for students to not work as expected.
* Fixed language strings for Icon Navigation so that multilanguage plugins will work on the text links.
* Fixed header logo to utilize standard bootstrap responsive classes.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.4.7 2017051700
* Fixed Radial Course Completion showing percent and decimal points.
* Added permissions for teacher dashboard links to check if they have the proper capability to access the links
* Fixed issue where hidden code for Course Management link was present for students in code.  Adjusted permission settings to completely remove it.
* Added frontpage custom login form just in case you do not force users to login.  This was sorely lacking in Fordson.
* Added course checks for: Show grades to students and enable course completion.  If the teacher shows the gradebook to students in course settings then a link to view grades will appear in the "This Course" sliding menu for students.  Same for course completion.  If course completion is set to Yes in course settings then a course completion radial will appear for students to view progress.
* SCSS fix to just import directly from Boost all default styles.
* Added theme admin setting to turn off completely show grade and course completion to students regardless of course settings.
* Fixed several layout and template issues.


## Fordson Moodle 33 1.4.6 2017051600
* Removed frontpage course search box as this can be accomplished by simply enabling it through normal frontpage settings for moodle.  We are also more focused on the Easy Enrollment form which allows students to enroll with a six digit code instantly.  It's not needed as it duplicates a built in function and we want to be as lean as possible.
* Cleaned up some language strings and Settings pages.
* Enhanced some of the styling when viewing course categories.  Applied a hover effect for activities in courses.
* Fixed undefined variable when using Easy Enrollment plugin at the site level but disabling it on a course. Also fixed unknown variable issue when Easy Enroll is not installed for some users.
* Changed some default settings for a better experience when first installing Fordson.
* First Implementation of the Student Dashboard slider now called "This Course". Will allow students to see course information at a glance. Very useful.
* This Course drop down menu has been incorporated into a new This Course slider (And Course Management slider if a teacher) which displays Course Completion, Gradebook Link, and other pertinent course information.
* Added logic so that teachers and non-editing teachers only see Course management panel while students only see This Course panel inside courses.  This eliminates any overlapping of sliding panels which can cause visual issues.

## Fordson Moodle 33 1.4.5 2017051200
* Fixed compatibility with collapsed topic course format thanks to Gareth
* Fixed issue when Easy Enrollment plugin was not installed and the course management panel integration

* Removed empty style folder carried over from Moodle 3.2 version
* New forumpost styling
* New Course Category display improvements such as hover effects and other micro interactions

## Fordson 1.4.4
* New integrations with Easy Enrollment plugin: When easy enrollment is activated on a course a new link appears which will show the teacher all their enrollment codes for the course.  This is in the header area just above the Turn Editing on button in the upper right of the course page.
* Prepped and ready for the release of Easy Enrollment Plugin on github
* Cleaned up classes and functions as to not override core more than needed.

## Fordson 1.4.3
* Added custom textbox to provide teachers a message in the Course Management Panel. 
* Added new items to Course Management Panel.
* Added logic to show/hide contextual menu when using the Course Management Panel.  This will hide the Editing Cog when using Course Management Panel and display it when not activated.  It also shows the menu only on the homepage when using Course Management Panel. You can also force the contextual menu to appear with the course management panel menu.
* Moved This Course drop down to be with the Course Management Panel menu. 
* fixed styling issues with presets and the new course management panel menu. 
* fixed responsive issues and the new course management panel menu. 
* Turn Editing On button is now visible at all times.  Previously it would hide when viewing on a phone but since you can now hide the contextual course editing cog it is important to be able to turn editing on from the button when not accessible from the menu. 
* Fixed ADA issue with each icon on homepage having the same ID=button.  Thanks Emma Richardson.
* Fixed HeaderLogo image on small screen sizes.  Thanks Emma Richardson.
 

## Fordson 1.4.2
* Introducing a brand new navigation concept: Teacher Course Management Panel.  This intuitive sliding panel displays a custom list of links that help the teacher manage the course.  It appears in the upper right side of the page just above the Turn Editing On button.  This is the first implementation and future plans include a custom textbox, icons, better descriptions, and other enahncements to make managing your course easier for the teachers.  
* Added Bootstrap Carousel left and right controls to autoplay slideshow.
* Multiple styling enhancements.


## Fordson 1.4.1
* Added Block Column width to control block widths in Fordson Content Areas page
* Added Boostrap Carousel slideshow with three slides to frontpage. Add a title, description, and image background.  Image background will scale with the size of the page and is not meant to contain actual content.  To be in ADA compliance we prefer to use the description text to display information and not text in a image.  
* Custom Logo upload for Fordson only appears on homepage above new slideshow so that once in a course the student is focused on content
* Moved Learning Content Spacing setting from Image Setting page to Content Settings Page since it is the spacing between the top of the page and the actual page content.

Special thanks to Alexander Bias with https://github.com/moodleuulm/moodle-local_boostnavigation and Carlos Escobedo with https://moodle.org/plugins/local_navigation.  I was able to combine these two plugins to remove default menu items and add new menu items.  Because this is done with a theme we also added a toggle to allow you to determine where the customizations appear.
